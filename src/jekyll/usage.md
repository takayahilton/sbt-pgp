title: SBT PGP Plugin - Usage
---

## Overview ##

This page contains detailed usage and configuration information for the `sbt-pgp` SBT plugin.  For general information on the `sbt-pgp` plugin, look [here](index.html).

## Configuration: GPG Command-Line Utility ##

`sbt-pgp` uses `gpg` by default. If you cant to use the built-in Bouncy Castle PGP implementation, this can be overriden with:

    useGpg := false

Or by setting `SBT_PGP_USE_GPG` environment variable to `0`.

`sbt-pgp` needs to know where the `gpg` executable is to run.  It will look for a either a `gpg` or `gpg.exe` executable on your `PATH` depdending on your platform.  To configure a different location, place the following in your `~/.sbt/gpg.sbt` file:

    gpgCommand := "/path/to/gpg"

By default `sbt-pgp` will use the default private keys from the standard gpg keyrings.   If you'd like to use a different private key for signing artifacts, add the following to your `~/.sbt/gpg.sbt` file:

    pgpSecretRing := file("/path/to/my/secring.gpg")

There is currently no way to choose a non-default key from the keyring.

### OpenPGP Support ###

If you are using a [Yubikey 4](https://www.yubico.com/product/yubikey-4-series/) or another smartcard that [supports OpenPGP](https://incenp.org/notes/2016/openpgp-card-implementations.html), then you may have private keys implemented directly on the smartcard rather than using the gpg keyring.  In this situation, you will use `gpg-agent` and a pinentry (`pinentry-mac`, `pinentry-qt`, `pinentry-curses` etc) rather than a passphrase.  Set `useGpgPinentry := true` in your `build.sbt` settings to configure `sbt-pgp` appropriately.

    useGpgAgent := true
    useGpgPinentry := true 

Note that `sbt-pgp` only supports OpenPGP through the GPG command line tool -- it is not available through bouncycastle.  In addition, you may need to explicitly [enable support for OpenPGP on the Yubikey 4](https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide).

# Creating a Key Pair #

To create a key pair, enter the following:

    > pgp-cmd gen-key
    
You will see something like:
 
    Please enter the name associated with the key: LAMP/EPFL
    Please enter the email associated with the key: lamp@gmail.com
    Please enter the passphrase for the key: *****************
    Please re-enter the passphrase for the key: *****************
    [info] Creating a new PGP key, this could take a long time.
    [info] Public key := /home/jsuereth/test-secring.pgp
    [info] Secret key := /home/jsuereth/test-pubring.pgp
    [info] Please do not share your secret key.   Your public key is free to share.

This will create a new public/secret key pair for you using the configured passphrase in the default location (`~/.sbt/gpg`).  If you already have a key in place, this will warn you and not generate a new key.

If you have a GPG key pair (the `~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg` and `~/.gnupg/secring.gpg` files exist), then the GPG plugin will assume you want these and prevent you from generating a new key.  You can override this by configuring your own key locations.

Alternatively, if you're using the `gpg` command-line utility:

    gpg --gen-key

You can record your password in a user-specific setting file:

    set pgpPassphrase := Some(Array('t','e','s','t'))

Or you can enter it on the command line when prompted by SBT:

    Please enter your PGP passphrase> ******

The purpose of this plugin is to promote security and authentication.  While some may want the feature to create a key without a passphrase, this plugin will not support that.

## Configuration: Automating Passphrase Entry ##

`sbt-pgp` will ask for your password once, and cache it for the duration of the SBT process.   The prompt will look something like this:

    Please enter your PGP passphrase> ***********

If you would like to avoid entering your password over and over, you can configure it with a setting:

    pgpPassphrase := Some(Array('M', 'y', 'P', 'a', 's', 's', 'p', 'h', 'r', 'a', 's', 'e'))

Note: The passphrase *must* be an array of characters.   It's mildy more secure.  We hope to provide even more secure ways of storing passphrases in the future.

Also make sure that the above setting is in a user-specific directory and that you don't advertise your password in the source code repository!

Another alternative for configuring the passphrase is to add it to your credentials, using a host name of `pgp`.  This allows you to globally configure a passphrase without having the pgp plugin installed globally.
 
For example, create the following file `~/.sbt/pgp.credentials`:

    realm=PGP Secret Key
    host=pgp
    user=sbt
    password=MyPassphrase
    
The `realm` and `user` values can be anything, the `host` must be `pgp`, and `password` must be your passphrase. Now add the this file to your sbt credentials in `~/.sbt/0.13/global.sbt`:

    credentials += Credentials(Path.userHome / ".sbt" / "pgp.credentials")    

## Configuration: Key Pair Locations ##

If you'd like to use a key that isn't in the standard location, you can configure it in your `~/.sbt/gpg.sbt` file:

    pgpSecretRing := file("/tmp/secring.asc")

    pgpPublicRing := file("/tmp/pubring.asc")

## Configuration: Signing Key ##

If you'd like to use a different private key besides the default, then you can configure it with the `pgpSigningKey` settings. 

You can either configure the key using raw long integer values:

    pgpSigningKey := Some(9005184038412874530)

or you can use the `usePgpKeyHex` method.

    usePgpKeyHex("7cf8d72be29df322")

Note:  While it is general practice to drop the higher-order bits of 64-bit integer keys when passing ids around, the PGP plugin requires the full key id currently.

## Configuration: Public Key Ring ##

You can configure the public key ring you use with the `gpgPublicRing` setting.

    pgpPublicRing := file("/home/me/pgp/pubring.asc")

By default the `~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg` file is used, if it exists.

## Validating PGP Keys ##

The plugin can be used to validate the PGP signatures of the dependencies of the project you're using.   To validate these signatures, simply use the `checkPgpSignatures` task:

    > checkPgpSignatures
    [info] Resolving org.scala-lang#scala-library;2.9.1 ...
    ...
    [info] ----- PGP Signature Results -----
    [info]                    com.novocode : junit-interface :        0.7 : jar   [MISSING]
    [info]               javax.transaction :             jta :     1.0.1B : jar   [MISSING]
    [info]          org.scala-lang.plugins :   continuations :      2.9.1 : jar   [MISSING]
    [info]                org.apache.derby :           derby : 10.5.3.0_1 : jar   [UNTRUSTED(0x98e21827)]
    [error] {file:/home/josh/projects/typesafe/test-signing/}test-gpg/*:check-pgp-signatures: Some artifacts have bad signatures or are signed by untrusted sources!
    [error] Total time: 2 s, completed Jan 23, 2012 12:03:28 PM
    
In the above output, the signature for derby is from an untrusted key (id: `0x98e21827`).  You can import this key into your public key ring, and then the plugin will trust artifacts from that key.   The public, by default, accepts any keys included in your public key ring file.

## Importing and Exporting Keys from Public Key Servers ##

Note: To import a key, you have to turn off read only mode:

    set pgpReadOnly := false

Use the `receive-key` command to import keys.

    pgp-cmd receive-key <key id> hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com   

Use the `send-key` command to export keys.

    pgp-cmd send-key <key id> hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com

The value of `key id` is one of the following:

* Hex Key ID
* "Name" of the key (e.g. "LAMP/EPFL" in the above example)
* "Email" of the key (e.g. "lamp@gmail.com" in the above example)

## Publishing Artifacts

To publish signed artifacts, use either `publishSigned` or `publishLocalSigned`.

## Skipping publishing

To skip the publish step, set `skip in publish` to `true`.

```
skip in publish := true
```
